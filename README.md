# Description

This is a social network API that allows users to create their own account, share their thoughts, add friends, and react to friendsâ€™ thoughts. This app also uses Express.js for routing, and MongoDB database.

The goal of doing this challenge was to practice building an API using a NoSQL database and basically develop the entire backend for a social networking program.

Because only the backend was required for this challenge, Insomnia Core was used to test the routes and functionality.
